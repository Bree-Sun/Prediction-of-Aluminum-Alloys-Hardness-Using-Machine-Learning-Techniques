# Prediction-of-Aluminum-Alloys-Hardness-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

Abstract:

In this project, a variety of machine learning models are used to speed up the design of Aluminum alloys by improving the precision of the prediction of the alloysâ€™ hardness. The raw data is extracted from existent literature, containing chemical compositional and physical metallurgical parameters, along with aging conditions and hardness. By employing more refined machine learning and data processing techniques, XG Boost regression model reported the best R2 value, pushing the value to be 6.2% higher than that from existing literature.

Flow chart for the project:
